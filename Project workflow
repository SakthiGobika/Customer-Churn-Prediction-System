🔍 Project Workflow
1️⃣ Data Loading & Understanding

Loaded Excel dataset using Pandas

Inspected data types, missing values, and target distribution

2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Feature Selection

Removed irrelevant and leakage columns (CustomerID, location data, churn reason, churn score)

Converted Total Charges from object to numeric

Handled missing values using median imputation

3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key insights:

Customers with month-to-month contracts have higher churn

Low tenure customers are more likely to churn

Higher monthly charges increase churn probability

Long-term contracts improve customer retention

4️⃣ Feature Engineering & Encoding

One-hot encoded categorical variables

Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler

5️⃣ Model Building

Baseline Model: Logistic Regression

Advanced Model: Random Forest Classifier

6️⃣ Model Evaluation

Evaluation metrics:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall (focused metric)

ROC-AUC Score

Random Forest outperformed the baseline model and was selected as the final model.

7️⃣ Feature Importance Analysis

Identified key churn drivers:

Contract type

Tenure months

Monthly charges

Internet service type

8️⃣ Model Saving

Trained model and scaler saved using joblib for future deployment
